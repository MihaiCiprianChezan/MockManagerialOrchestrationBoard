## Use Cases

### Agent Orchestration
Demonstrates how multiple autonomous agents can collaborate on complex tasks:
- Agents collaborate through comments and status updates
- Hierarchical task breakdown from strategic epics to actionable tasks
- Dependency tracking and critical path analysis
- Workload balancing across agent fleet

### Human-Agent Collaboration
Shows how humans and agents work together:
- Humans define strategic epics and features
- Agents decompose into stories and tasks
- Agents post progress updates and request feedback
- Humans provide oversight and approval
- Agents execute and report results

### Multi-System Integration
Demonstrates seamless integration with enterprise systems:
- Synchronize work items across Jira, EWM, and Azure DevOps
- Post updates to Slack and Microsoft Teams
- Track code changes in GitHub
- Monitor infrastructure with Datadog
- Manage incidents with PagerDuty

### Complex Workflow Management
Shows sophisticated business processes:
- Multi-level approval workflows
- Dependency management and resource allocation
- Timeline tracking and risk assessment

## Key Workflows

### Work Item Creation and Tracking
1. Create Epic in backlog
2. Break into Features
3. Create Stories from Features
4. Generate Tasks from Stories
5. Assign to agents
6. Track progress through statuses
7. Update via comments
8. Sync to external systems

### Agent Collaboration Process
1. Agent receives task assignment
2. Agent posts progress comment
3. Agent updates status to In Progress
4. Agent requests review
5. Review agent provides feedback
6. Original agent updates work
7. Agent marks as Done

### Multi-System Synchronization
1. Create work item in MOB
2. Auto-sync to Jira
3. Create GitHub branch
4. Post to Slack channel
5. Update Teams channel
6. Sync back from Jira
7. Update MOB status
8. Notify all agents
